      <h2>Privacy Policy</h2>
      <p>We take the protection of your personal data very seriously. This privacy policy informs you about the nature, scope, and purposes of the processing of personal data within our application. We store and process your data exclusively locally on your device in your browser's LocalStorage. No transmission of your data to external servers or third parties occurs.</p>

      <h3>Local Storage</h3>
      <p>This application uses the browser's LocalStorage to store data directly on your device. These data include settings for the espresso, espresso varieties, and measurements for the espresso shots that you enter within the application or that are necessary for the functionality of the application. The advantage of this storage method is that your data remains completely under your control and is not transmitted to our or external servers.</p>

      <h3>Access to Local Data</h3>
      <p>You always have the option to view, export, or delete the data stored in LocalStorage. Please note that deleting this data can affect the functionality of the application.</p>

      <h3>Hosting and Security</h3>
      <p>Our application is hosted on GitHub Pages. GitHub Pages is a hosting platform that enables the publication of web content directly from a GitHub repository. Although GitHub Pages offers secure hosting services, the responsibility for the security of your local data lies with you, as it is stored directly on your device.</p>

      <h3>Changes to the Privacy Policy</h3>
      <p>We reserve the right to adjust this privacy policy to adapt it to changed legal situations or changes in the application and data processing. We recommend that you regularly inform yourself about the protection of your personal data.</p>
